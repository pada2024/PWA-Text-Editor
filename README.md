# PWA-Text-Editor
A text editor that runs in the browser.

## Description

A single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

#Learning
I learned how to build a standalone app that run without a browser. I ran into some challenges with case, but am learning new tools to mitigate that. This app is fully executed. 


## Installation
npm run start:dev

## Usage

After you establish the port, you visit it in the browser. From there, you may need to do a hard refress due to caching. You can intall the app and save it wherever. You can test the offline functionalit in develper's console under network. You will navigate to networks > applications > indexDB and enter in a value to see it recorded as per my code.
